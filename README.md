This is my contribution to the CaixaBank Tech Hackathlon
A small financial application made with React 


## Background 

I was very motivated to participate in this challenge, it is the first time I participate in a hackathon, and I think it is an opportunity to challenge yourself, put into practice what you have learned, learn a lot more...besides meeting very interesting people.

## Quick start

npm i


npm start


## Tech Stack

React
JS
Sass
HTML

I have decided to run this application with React JS even though I think it would have been more appropriate to use React Native.
However, I am still developing my knowledge in the subject, and React Native is the next goal.

## Libraries
Charts:
I chose this library because of its incredible ease of use and very good results.
